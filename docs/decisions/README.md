# Architecture Decision Records

Architecture decision records (ADRs) capture choices that materially shape ThyTrader. They explain context and consequences so future contributors can change direction deliberately rather than accidentally.

## Accepted decisions

| ADR | Decision | Status |
|---|---|---|
| [0001](0001-sveltekit-frontend.md) | Use SvelteKit/Svelte 5 with TypeScript for the application UI | Accepted |
| [0002](0002-modular-monolith.md) | Start as a modular monolith with separate API and worker processes | Accepted |
| [0003](0003-polyglot-storage.md) | Use PostgreSQL operationally and Parquet/Polars/DuckDB analytically | Accepted |
| [0004](0004-safe-execution-and-access.md) | Use maker-first execution, risk-first exits, loopback-safe deployment, and restrictive credential permissions | Superseded in part by 0006 |

| [0007](0007-immutable-research-run-specifications.md) | Publish immutable research-run specifications before simulation | Accepted |

| [0009](0009-deterministic-bar-level-backtest-engine.md) | Version bar-level backtest simulation separately from signal evaluation | Accepted |
